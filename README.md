<b>Enhanced diabetes prediction through Machine Learning and ontology</b>

Diabetes is a chronic disease that has been on the rise year after year. The challenges emerge when diabetes is not
detected early and diagnosed promptly. Recently, a range of machine learning techniques, including ontology-based
ML methods, have made significant strides in medical science by creating automated systems for detecting diabetes
patients.

We are going to use deep learning algorithms, such as

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Na√Øve Bayes

. The evaluation of results was based on performance metrics like Recall, Accuracy, Precision, and F-Measure,
derived from the confusion matrix..

The experimental findings revealed that ontology classifiers and SVM provided the highest accuracy.


<b>Ad free Search Engine</b>
People have a high level of trust in search engines, especially Google, but only limited
knowledge of them, as numerous studies have shown. This leads to the question: To what extent
is this trust justified considering the lack of familiarity among users with how search engines
work and the business models they are founded on? We assume that trust in Google, search
engine preferences, and knowledge of result types are interrelated. To examine this assumption,
we conducted a representative online survey with n = 2,012 German internet users. We show
that users with little search engine knowledge are more likely to trust and use Google than users
with more knowledge. A contradiction revealed itself ‚Äî users strongly trust Google, yet they
are unable to adequately evaluate search results. This may be problematic since it can
potentially affect knowledge acquisition. Consequently, there is a need to promote user
information literacy to create a more solid foundation for user trust in search engines

- <b>ONLINE SHOPPING SYSTEM </b>
  - <b>Using php and mysql</b>
The Online Shopping is a web based application intended for online retailers. The main
objective of this application is to make it interactive and its ease of use. It would make
searching, viewing and selection of a product easier. It contains a sophisticated search
engine for user's to search for products specific to their needs. The search engine provides
an easy and convenient way to search for products where a user can Search for a product
interactively and the search engine would refine the products available based on the
user‚Äôs input. The user can then view the complete specification of each product. They can
also view the product reviews and also write their own reviews. The application also
provides a drag and drop feature so that a user can add a product to the shopping cart by
dragging the item in to the shopping cart. The main emphasis lies in providing a userfriendly
search engine for effectively showing the desired results and its drag and drop
behavior.
